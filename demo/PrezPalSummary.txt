Problem statement: PowerPoint slides are tedious and time-consuming to produce. Furthermore, they are static during the delivery; you cannot change the slide content while presenting, so presentations cannot introduce new content or address audience questions. We introduce a new paradigm: Instead of preparing slides ahead of the delivery, we dynamically generate slides in real time using our new PrezPal product. Operations: At the end of each slide, the presenter uses voice commands to subtly prompt PrezPal to generate the next slide. For example, if I ask PrezPal to discuss product performance, PrezPal will create a slide with graphs and figures related to the product's performance. PrezPal draws upon a presentation summary and a database of relevant images to create the next PowerPoint slide. GPT-3.5 Turbo helps generate the best bullet points and select the most relevant images. This presentation: As proof of the efficacy, this presentation was created by PrezPal! We created the title slide manually to establish the initial content, but every slide after that was generated using our algorithm. Data science: PrezPal leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo, a sophisticated large language model by OpenAI. We have employed few-shot machine learning to train a GPT instance to build readable PowerPoint presentations. Voice command requests for new slides are handled by wave2vec, a deep learning speech-to-text transcriber, and MATLAB's Audio and Deep Learning toolboxes. We leverage several machine learning models together to build an intuitive user experience. The machine learning outputs are passed to MATLAB's Report Generator toolbox to create our PowerPoint slides. Features and future work: Observe that PrezPal creates slides real-time. If an audience member asked for a slide on unexpected topics, we would be able to generate an appropriate response. We have both text and image graphics. Future versions of PrezPal will interact with videos, slide animations, GIFs, and custom themes. We will also optimize for the computation time so that the slides can be created faster. Our most ambitious feature is real-time data analysis: if an audience member asks a quantitative question, we want PrezPal to be able to analyze stored datasets to provide graphs and solutions immediately.
